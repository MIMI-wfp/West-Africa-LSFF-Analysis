West Africa LSFF Analysis

Harmonized analysis of micronutrient inadequacy and access to fortifiable staples across 10 West African countries, with reproducible code and maps.
Countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea‑Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo
Nutrients: Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, Folate, Vitamin B12 

🔎 Background

Micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in West Africa due to inadequate diets and low intake of essential vitamins and minerals. Large-Scale Food Fortification (LSFF) is central to regional nutrition strategies, yet evidence is limited on whether nutrition vulnerability aligns with access to fortifiable food vehicles.
This repository provides a harmonized, multi‑country assessment of:
Mean Probability of Inadequacy (MPI)
Household vulnerability to inadequate intakes (vitamin A, iron, zinc, folate, B12)
Reach and consumption of fortifiable staples (wheat flour, edible oil, rice, millet, sorghum, maize)
Disaggregation by country (national), geography (ADM1/ADM2), and socioeconomic position

🧪 Methods (summary)

Data: Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES) from 10 West African countries
Framework: Nutrient supply modeling using household apparent intakes, converted to adult female equivalent (AFE)
Estimates:
MPI and % of households at risk of inadequacy for vitamin A, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin B12
Food vehicle reach and median per capita daily consumption for major staples
Survey design: Weighted estimates using srvyr::as_survey_design(ids = ea, strata = res, weights = survey_wgt[, nest=TRUE])

📊 Key Results (high‑level)

National MPIs ranged 0.56–0.73, indicating widespread inadequacy
50% of households vulnerable to iron, zinc, and folate inadequacy across all countries
Vitamin A and B12 inadequacy substantial in several contexts
Vulnerability is geographically patterned and higher among poorer households
Rice has the highest regional reach; maize is major in specific countries; millet/sorghum reach poorer Sahelian populations; wheat flour & edible oil show lower per‑capita consumption and lower reach in the poorest quintiles
