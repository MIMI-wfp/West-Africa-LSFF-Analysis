West Africa LSFF Analysis

Harmonized analysis of micronutrient inadequacy and access to fortifiable staples across 10 West African countries, with reproducible code and maps.
Countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea‑Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo.
Nutrients: Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, Folate, Vitamin B12 

🔎 Background

Micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in West Africa due to inadequate diets and low intake of essential vitamins and minerals. Large-Scale Food Fortification (LSFF) is central to regional nutrition strategies, yet evidence is limited on whether nutrition vulnerability aligns with access to fortifiable food vehicles.
This repository provides a harmonized, multi‑country assessment of:
Household vulnerability to inadequate intakes (vitamin A, iron, zinc, folate, B12),
Reach and consumption of fortifiable staples (wheat flour, edible oil, rice, millet, sorghum, maize) and
Disaggregation by country (national), geography (ADM1/ADM2), and socioeconomic position

🧪 Methods (summary)

Data: Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES) from 10 West African countries.
Estimates:
MPI and % of households at risk of inadequacy for vitamin A, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin B12 and
Food vehicle reach and disaggregated per capita daily consumption for major staples

📊 Key Results (high‑level)

National MPIs ranged 0.56–0.73, indicating widespread inadequacy.
50% of households vulnerable to iron, zinc, and folate inadequacy across all countries, 
Vitamin A and B12 inadequacy substantial in several contexts, 
Vulnerability is geographically patterned and higher among poorer households, 
Rice has the highest regional reach; maize is major in specific countries; millet/sorghum reach poorer Sahelian populations; wheat flour & edible oil show lower per‑capita consumption and lower reach in the poorest quintiles
